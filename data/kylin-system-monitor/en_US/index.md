### CPU history
The dynamic line graph counts the historical CPU usage, and the upper right lab

el displays real-time CPU usage data.

### Memory and swap space history
The dynamic line graph counts the total historical occupation of the running me

mory and swap space of the system, and the label on the upper right shows the r

eal-time occupation-Dosage and total amount.

### Net history
Dynamic line chart statistics system receives and sends historical data of traf

fic, the upper right shows real-time network receiving and network sending rate

<br>

## File system module function
